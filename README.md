# Getting Started

I prepared an easy way to run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:viniciuschan/transactions-api.git
```

2. In the project root directory, there are some useful Makefile commands.

3. You can check all test cases by running:
```
make test
```

4. To start the service using docker-compose run the following command:
```
make run
```

5. As soon as your containers are up, you must migrate the data structure:
```
make migrate
```

6. I prepared a fixture file to load initial items for testing purposes:
```
make create_fixtures
```
